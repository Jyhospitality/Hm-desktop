    </div>


    <div class="container">

        <div class="single-page-container">
            <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                A channel manager is a software tool that enables achieving multichannel inventory distribution with instant updates of prices and availability. In other words, it allows you to simultaneously sell your inventory across several websites and provide customers
                with actual information on prices and a property occupancy.
                <br>
                <br> A channel manager can be a stand-alone solution or part of a hotel’s property management system (PMS)
                <br>
                <br>Below are the 5 Points which Emphasizes why Every Hotel must have a Channel Manager.



            </p>
            <!-- <h2 class="title">Research</h2>  -->

            <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                <ul>
                    <li>(1)Inventory and Distribution Management:- </li>
                    <p>Needless to say, managing and diversifying the hotel’s distribution is as crucial as promoting your property through a variety of channels, increases visibility, drives occupancy, and consequently, increases profit. Developing a successful
                        distribution strategy is about choosing the right number and mix of channels. Revenue Managers need to think and apply how they want to distribute the inventory among OTA’s, Meta Sites, GDS, Corporate Sales, Having a Channel Manager
                        eases the life of a Revenue Manager where he can check and decide how to distribute his Inventories. This is the reason a Channel Manager is very important for a hotel for Proper Inventory and Distribution Management.
                    </p>
                    <li>(2) Seamless and Integrated Tech Stack:- </li>
                    <p>Manual data entry is time-consuming and frustrating, we all know that, also there are chances of making errors. If you were to use a channel manager and remove this friction, you’d realize just how much more productive you can be,
                        just at one single click bulk updates can happen. <br>

                        <br>(a) Reduces Time and efforts :- If one has to update inventory or rates, doing it individually from each extranet will take time, at a critical moment it may happen when you are about to update Sold out,suddenly from no where
                        you ll see a booking pops up and then you realize you had forget to update the Sold Out on that portal, this is where Channel Manager comes into picture, which ensures once the OTA’s are mapped, everything can be updated from one
                        Single place. <br>
                        <br> (b) Chances of making Error is less:- Here we have to keep in mind that Chances of making Error is less not Zero, many times while updating the rates on different platform for different rates it may happen that the Revenue
                        Manager makes mistake, because of updating it at so many places, but Once all the OTA’s are mapped, the rates for an entire year, including Peak Season and Lean Season can be uploaded within minutes.The Revenue Manager should double
                        check if all the OTA’s are mapped to the Channel Manager, if there is unmapped channels the updates won’t go through.
                    </p>
                    <li>(3) Dashboard to Strategise Rates and Inventory:-</li>

                    <p> One gets a single Dashboard in Channel Manager, where he can see an insightful overview of all the Channels connected and their Contribution for the day
                    </p>
                    <p>The Dashboard helps the Revenue Managers to take a quick decision regarding the rates and inventory allocation, again all this happens with very less Human Intervention
                    </p>
                    <p>There is a series of Channel Manager which provides the Monthly sales and the source right on the Dashboard to check which portal is contributing. This helps the Revenue Managers to focus and drive business from channels which are
                        lacking
                    </p>
                    <li>(4) Bulk Update and Rate Parity:- </li>
                    <p>Channel manager systems are developed to automatically maintain efficient rates to ensure that any changes you make on a system are unanimously updated across all platforms in real-time, leaving no room for errors. Thus, you can avoid
                        rate disparity and enhance your hotel’s online reputation. Also one can update the rate for the entire 365 days at one go, the latest feature in many Channel Managers are that once the peak dates rates are updated, it can be blocked
                        so that in future when we do bulk Update those rates won’t override.</p>
                    <li>(5)Analytics and Reports capabilities:- </li>
                    <p> Informed is forearmed. Opt for a channel manager providing detailed analytics and reporting. Insights on revenue per channel, booking volume, total revenue for a specific amount of time, competitor analysis, or parity rate will help
                        you develop your distribution strategy.</p>

                </ul>

            <h2 class="title">Influencer Marketing
            </h2>

            <p style="font-size: 24px;">
                For a long time, influencer marketing has been a popular marketing strategy. That will not change in
                2022.<br><br>
                Influential people have a lot of clout. However, these services come at a high cost. As a result,
                marketers have turned to minor influencers such as comedians, podcast hosts, and others. We predict
                marketers to pick smaller influencers with lesser audiences than micro-influencers in 2022. These are
                regular people who are devoted to the brand for organic reasons. This may be one of your current
                visitors who has a sizable social media following.<br><br>For decades, funnel marketing has dominated.
                While not entirely out of the question, "flywheel marketing" is projected to gain traction in
                2022.<br><br>What exactly is the flywheel strategy? It's all about keeping customers satisfied and
                focusing on ways to keep them coming back for more. As a marketing strategy, it employs client marketing
                methods and great customer service, as well as loyalty programmes and other direct interaction
                strategies. It places visitors at the centre of marketing and cultivates them as brand ambassadors to
                bring in new customers.<br><br>Hoteliers must adapt to survive as the fabric of today's marketing
                environment continues to alter. To successfully engage with its visitors, hotels and vacation rentals
                must stay on top of these dramatic trends. Create and implement an effective marketing strategy based on
                these trends while being flexible enough to respond to the next change. -->
